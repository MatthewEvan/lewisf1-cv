# Lewis Hamilton CV
Welcome to my other website that I'd worked on for a month after learning basic HTML & CSS  
  
> ### **Why did I make this website ?**
I have been a fan of Formula 1 since I'd started watching races online back in 2022  
Since then, I have a favorite racer that I adore from time to time, who's none other than  
**<h1 style="background-color: #141F1F; color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center; font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">Lewis Hamilton</h1>**

> ### **Table of Contents**
- Introduction to Formula One
- Image Gallery and Pictures
- Lewis Hamilton's Main CV  

So, that's all from me for this website. Thanks
